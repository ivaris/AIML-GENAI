        "In today’s fast-paced healthcare environment, doctors often struggle with the time-consuming task of documenting patient consultations. These conversations are usually long, unstructured, and difficult to review later, which makes writing and editing notes a heavy burden. The inefficiencies carry over into follow-ups, as important details may be buried within lengthy transcripts. To address this challenge, a healthcare technology team is developing an LLM-powered assistant designed to streamline clinical documentation. This AI assistant will automatically generate structured summaries, highlight key patient details, and organize consultation notes for easy review. By applying this solution to real-world consultation data, the team aims to demonstrate how advanced language models can reduce administrative workload, minimize errors, and ultimately improve the quality of patient care."
