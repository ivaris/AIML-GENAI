        "\n",
        "1. **Operational Efficiency** - Logistics managers and supply chain teams no longer need to manually search for country-specific compliance documents or duty payment methods. The assistant delivers structured, accurate, and timely information, accelerating decision-making and reducing turnaround time per shipment.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Error Reduction and Compliance Assurance** - Trade compliance errors can be costly, leading to shipment delays, penalties, or reputational risks. Automating document retrieval and payment obligation identification minimizes human oversight and ensures that shipments meet international regulatory requirements consistently.\n",

        "3. **Scalability Across Clients and Regions** - With Greatglobe handling 20–30 clients and over 500 products across multiple domains, the assistant is designed to scale.
