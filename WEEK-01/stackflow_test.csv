"Title: Neural network weird predictionQuery: <p>I try to implement a neural network. I'm using backpropagation to compute the gradients. After obtaining the gradients, I multiply them by the learning rate and subtract them from the corresponding weights. (basically trying to apply gradient descent, please tell me if this is wrong).
So the first thing I tried after having the backpropagation and gradient descent ready, was to train a simple XOR classifier where the inputs can be (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) and the corresponding outputs are 0, 1, 1, 0. So my neural network contains 2 input units, 1 output unit and one hidden layer with 3 units on it. When training it with a learning rate of 3.0 for >100 (even tried >5000), the cost drops until a specific point where it gets stuck, so it's remaining constant. The weights are randomly initialized each time I run the program, but it always gets stuck at the same specific cost. Anyways, after the training is finished I tried to run my neural network on any of the above inputs and the output is always 0.5000. I thought about changing the inputs and outputs so they are : (-1,-1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, 1) and the outputs -1, 1, 1, -1. Now when trained with the same learning rate, the cost is dropping continuously, no matter the number of iterations but the results are still wrong, and they always tend to be very close to 0. I even tried to train it for an insane number of iterations and the results are the following: [ iterations: (20kk), inputs:(1, -1), output:(1.6667e-08) ] and also [iterations: (200kk), inputs:(1, -1), output:(1.6667e-09) ], also tried for inputs(1,1) and others, the output is also very close to 0. It seems like the output is always mean(min(y), max(y)), it doesn't matter in what form I provide the input/output. I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong, can someone please help?</p>

"Title: How to fix commit order in GitHub pull requests, broken by git rebase?Query: <p>When I write code I break it into small logical changes that are easy and quick to review.</p>

<p>To do so, I use <code>git rebase -i</code> (interactive) to squash, drop and change order of commits.</p>

<p>I've noticed this sometimes leads to a different order of commits on a GitHub pull request (though the order is retained on the remote branch). </p>

<p>For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>commit 1</li>
<li>commit 2</li>
<li>commit 3</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you rewrite your commit history via git rebase or a force push, you
  may notice that your commit sequence is out of order when opening a
  pull request.</p>
  
  <p>GitHub emphasizes Pull Requests as a space for discussion. All aspects
  of it--comments, references, and commits--are represented in a
  chronological order. Rewriting your Git commit history <a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase"" rel=""noreferrer"">while
  performing rebases</a> alters the space-time continuum, which means
  that commits may not be represented the way you expect them to in the
  GitHub interface.</p>
  
  <p>If you always want to see commits in order, we recommend not using
  <code>git rebase</code>. However, rest assured that nothing is broken when you
  see things outside of a chronological order!</p>

"Title: General android programming guide linesQuery: <p>I have been programming on android for the past few months and have hit a point where I comprehend the basic ideas and principles for Android development. </p>

<p>Currently I think that my code lacks the appropriate structure and clearance that is required in order for your code to be readable. I know this because sometimes even I find it hard to read my code - and I am not talking about the variable or classes names. I am talking about for example when I open a big ( lengthy ) activity and have 5 overriden methods, 5 more and tons of global variables, a couple of inner-classes and so on it gets hard to find stuff in.</p>

<p>Therefore I have been looking for some guide lines for how to do this so that the code looks good and is readable but I haven't been able to. </p>

<p>There are also small problems to which I find hard to find an answer and usually go with what i feel like rather than knowing for sure what is right in the situation. For example what is better - having the activity implement onClickListener and then having a big switch statement, or just creating new listener for every UI element. </p>
